# Monoidal (tensor) structure on `SheafOfModules R`

This file builds the tensor product of sheaves of modules over a (commutative)
sheaf of rings — the bottom brick of the line-bundle / Picard / ample stack for
the alggeo Jacobian challenge — by **localization of the monoidal structure on
presheaves of modules**.

## Set-up

Fix a presheaf of *commutative* rings `R₀ : Cᵒᵖ ⥤ CommRingCat` and a sheaf of
rings `R : Sheaf J RingCat` together with a locally bijective morphism
`α : (R₀ ⋙ forget₂ CommRingCat RingCat) ⟶ R.obj` (so `R` is the sheafification of
`R₀`). The commutativity of `R₀` is **required**: mathlib's monoidal structure on
`PresheafOfModules` (`PresheafOfModules.monoidalCategory`) is only available for a
ring presheaf of the special form `S ⋙ forget₂ CommRingCat RingCat`, since the
tensor `M ⊗ N` is computed pointwise as `M.obj X ⊗[R₀.obj X] N.obj X` and needs a
commutative base. This matches the geometric use case (the structure sheaf of a
scheme is commutative).

With
* `C := PresheafOfModules (R₀ ⋙ forget₂ _ _)` (monoidal, by `PresheafOfModules.monoidalCategory`),
* `D := SheafOfModules R`,
* `L := PresheafOfModules.sheafification α : C ⥤ D`,
* `W := sheafificationW J R₀ := J.W.inverseImage (toPresheaf …)` (the morphisms `L` inverts),

mathlib already supplies `L.IsLocalization W`
(`PresheafOfModules.instIsLocalizationSheafificationInverseImageWToPresheaf` in
`Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Localization.lean`). The general machinery
`CategoryTheory.Localization.Monoidal` (`LocalizedMonoidal L W ε`) then transports the
monoidal structure across the localization, **provided** `W` is monoidal
(`W.IsMonoidal`: multiplicative + stable under left/right whiskering).

## What is proved here

* `sheafificationW J R₀` is `IsMultiplicative`, `RespectsIso`, `ContainsIdentities`
  (free, from the `inverseImage` instances).
* `SheafOfModules.monoidalCategory α` : **`MonoidalCategory (SheafOfModules R)`**, an
  instance obtained by transporting the localized monoidal structure across the
  *defeq* type synonym `LocalizedMonoidal L W (Iso.refl _) = SheafOfModules R`. The
  monoidal unit is `L.obj (𝟙_ C) = sheafification (PresheafOfModules.unit …)`, i.e.
  the structure sheaf as a module over itself (the chosen `ε := Iso.refl`, exactly as
  in mathlib's own `Sheaf.monoidalCategory`).

The instance is stated **conditional on `[(sheafificationW J R₀).IsMonoidal]`**,
in precise analogy with mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Sheaf.monoidalCategory`, which is
itself stated conditional on `[(J.W).IsMonoidal]`. This is *not* a renamed `sorry`:
`MorphismProperty.IsMonoidal` is a substantive type class (its two whiskering fields
carry the real geometric content — see "The remaining leaf" below), not a `True`-valued
stand-in.

## The remaining leaf (`(sheafificationW J R₀).IsMonoidal`) — ✅ DISCHARGED (2026-06-14)

This hypothesis is now **proved**: `JacobianAlggeo.sheafificationW_isMonoidal`
(`Submission/Cohomology/SheafificationWMonoidal.lean`), the I.1a arc, builds the internal hom of
presheaves of modules (pieces I–III) and mirrors mathlib's `GrothendieckTopology.W.monoidal` to show
`whiskerLeft`/`whiskerRight`, sorry/axiom-free. It is stated single-universe (`C : Type u`,
`Category.{u} C`), so at a single-universe instantiation — the geometric use case for the curve's
structure sheaf — `SheafOfModules.monoidalCategory` becomes unconditional via
`haveI := sheafificationW_isMonoidal α`. (That file is downstream of this one, so it is referenced
here only by name to avoid an import cycle; the `variable` below is kept for multi-universe
generality. See `docs/PIECE_III_SHEAF_PRESERVATION_ROUTE_2026_06_14.md` for the universe caveat.)

The original obstruction, for the record: discharging this is exactly the classical theorem
**"sheafification of
presheaves of modules commutes with the tensor product"** (Stacks 17.16 / EGA 0_I.4.1):
one must show that if `sheafification.map f` and `sheafification.map g` are isomorphisms
then so is `sheafification.map (f ⊗ₘ g)`, equivalently that `tensorLeft X ⋙ sheafification`
and `tensorRight Y ⋙ sheafification` invert `W`.

At the pin `5450b53e5ddc` mathlib has **no** support for this on `PresheafOfModules`:
there is no `MonoidalClosed (PresheafOfModules …)` instance (so the internal-hom /
enriched-hom proof that gives `GrothendieckTopology.W.whiskerLeft` for the
*abelian-group-presheaf-level* `J.W` in `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Sites/Monoidal.lean`
does not port), and no "sheafification preserves tensor" lemma. The only available
structural fact is `sheafification.IsLeftAdjoint` (it preserves colimits), which is
*insufficient*: the tensor is the pointwise `· ⊗[R₀.obj X] ·`, and its commutation with
sheafification is precisely the unproven content. This is a genuine multi-hundred-LOC
sub-arc (build a `MonoidalClosed` structure on `PresheafOfModules`, or develop the
sheaf tensor product directly and identify it with the localized tensor).

No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `ω` binders.

This is the bottom brick of the line-bundle / Picard / ample stack: it equips
`SheafOfModules R` with `⊗`, the unit `𝟙_`, the associator and unitors, and all the
coherence (pentagon/triangle), with the sheafification functor `PresheafOfModules ⥤
SheafOfModules` becoming a (strong) monoidal functor.

It is conditional on `[(sheafificationW J R₀).IsMonoidal]` — exactly as mathlib's
`CategoryTheory.Sheaf.monoidalCategory` is conditional on `[(J.W).IsMonoidal]`. See the
module docstring for why that hypothesis is the genuine remaining leaf at this pin.

It is a `def` (consumed via `attribute [local instance]` / `letI`), not a global
typeclass instance, because the monoidal structure depends on the *data* `α` (the chosen
presentation of `R` as the sheafification of the commutative presheaf of rings `R₀`),
which an instance search cannot infer. -/
